# microntology
microntology: a lightweight, data-driven controlled vocabulary to describe Earth's microbial habitats.

`microntology` follows five core design principles: it is
* data-driven, encompassing terms to describe frequent sample types in existing data
* pragmatic and query-oriented, defining terms at intermediate resolutions to facilitate user access and browsing
* shallow, with only few hierarchical levels of classes
* cross-linked between related terms from different hierarchical paths
* designed for parsimonious multi-tagging where individual samples are described by multiple independent terms, rather than a ‘best match’ highly detailed single term
